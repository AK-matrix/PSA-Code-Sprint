Kindly escalate if necessary.\n\nBest Regards,\nProblem Statement: Issue:\nThe vessel SPIRIT OF BERTRAM (0ZN65W1MA) with reference CS0057455/L is missing TLI (Terminal Loading Instructions). There is an inquiry about whether additional costs have been incurred for the TLI declaration.\nImpact:\nThe TLI is not present, which could potentially cause delays or additional charges due to missed declarations or processing errors.\nSolution: Verify TLI Status:\nCheck the system or database to confirm if the TLI for SPIRIT OF BERTRAM has been declared or logged correctly. This involves querying the TLI database or TLI submission system.\nReview the TLI Submission Process:\nInvestigate the TLI submission process to identify if the TLI was missed due to manual errors or system failures. Verify if there was any API failure or data sync issue preventing the TLI from being properly logged.\nCheck for Additional Costs:\nDetermine if there are additional charges tied to the missing TLI. This could involve checking the billing system for any fees or penalties associated with late declarations.\nResolve System Sync Issues (if applicable):\nIf the missing TLI is due to a system sync issue, work with the IT team to resolve any data inconsistencies between the TLI declaration system and the billing system to prevent further discrepancies.\nSOP Reference:"
